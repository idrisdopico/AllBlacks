<h3> All Blacks Rugby </h3>
<img id="teamPic" src="views/img/team.jpg">
<p> New Zealand's national team and highest level of rugby representation achievable in the country, the All Blacks are the most successful international rugby side of all-time. With a winning percentage of 76.4 over 526 Tests (1903-2014) they are noted as one of the most prolific teams across any sport.
<br><br>
The first rugby nation to win 400 Test matches, the All Blacks are the current Rugby World Cup champions, winning the title in 2011 adding to the inaugural Cup they claimed in 1987. They have also won 10 of the 16 Tri-Nations trophies, all three of The Rugby Championships on offer, and have most recently have held the Bledisloe Cup for 12 years (2003-2014).
<br><br>
Overseas the side’s success is notable, winning four of nine attempted touring Grand Slams in 1978, 2005, 2008 and 2010 – while being victorious in 190 of 271 Test matches in foreign territory.
<br><br>
Since October 2003, when World Rugby (formerly the IRB) introduced a rankings system, the All Blacks have held number one position for over 80% of the time. In late 2014 New Zealand celebrated a unique milestone, ranked as the top ranked team for over five years without interruption. The side have also claimed World Rugby’s Team of the Year eight times in the last ten years. </p>
